    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Dough</li>
      <li>Sauce</li>
      <li>Cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><h3>Step-1</h3></li>
      <p>
        Combine water and yeast in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens
        and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.
      </p>

      <li><h3>Step-2</h3></li>
      <p>
        Combine flour and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with
        a dough hook attachment. Pour in yeast mixture. Knead dough until
        smooth, about 7 minutes.
      </p>

      <li><h3>Step-3</h3></li>
      <p>
        Grease a large bowl lightly with olive oil. Form dough into a tight ball
        and lightly grease the top. Place in the bowl; cover loosely with
        plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.
      </p>

      <li><h3>Step-4</h3></li>
      <p>
        Mix crushed tomatoes and pizza sauce together in a bowl to make sauce.
      </p>

      <li><h3>Step-5</h3></li>
      <p>
        Grease a heavy-gauge rimmed 12x17-inch baking sheet generously with
        olive oil. Press dough into the bottom. Prick dough all over with a
        fork. Arrange mozzarella cheese slices over dough; cover with 1 cup
        sauce. Sprinkle Pecorino Romano cheese on top. Drizzle remaining olive
        oil over pizza.
      </p>

      <li><h3>Step-6</h3></li>
      <p>Let pizza rise in a warm area until puffy, about 1 hour.</p>

      <li><h3>Step-7</h3></li>
      <p>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</p>

      <li><h3>Step-8</h3></li>
      <p>
        Bake pizza on the center rack of the preheated oven until edges are very
        dark brown but top is not burnt, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5
        minutes before slicing into squares.
